1. Question 1
Given an array of 2N positive integers. There are N rounds, in each round, you have to choose two positive integers and delete them.
Score in each round = gcd(num1,num2)*round_number
**Determine the maximum total score** 

Input -
N = 3
A = [8, 5, 6, 25, 6, 16]

Output -
8*3 + 6*2 + 5*1 = 37
